# LED Football
LED football written in MIT's scratch

# Motivation
My son learned Scratch in middle-school, and at the time I decided I needed to learn about how Scratch worked. That journey caused me to create this, a "remake" of the classic hand-held LED football game. It's a 100% clone, as I added a few twists while "writting" it.

# Code
The "code" obviously requires Scratch, so preview at:

Or download Scratch and get the project file from the repo here.

# Notes
Originally written using Scratch 2.0, but tested and works in the Scratch 3.0 beta.

Scratch 3.0 is scheduled for release in 2019, and is written in HTML5 -- no more Flash!
